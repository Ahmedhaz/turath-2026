# Turath2026 · native shells

`mobile/` turns the site in this repo ([ahmedhaz.github.io/turath-2026](https://ahmedhaz.github.io/turath-2026/))
into an iOS and Android app with Capacitor.
The site itself is never edited: `npm run build` bundles the rest of this repo into `www/`, so the app reads
**offline**: all 387 pages, the search index and the site's fonts ship inside it.
Bundle id `com.turath2026.app`, team `M3RPNM736H`, iOS 15.5+, iPhone only, portrait only. Android 6+.

## What the build changes, and why

`scripts/build-www.mjs` copies the site and fixes three things at build time:

| Site | App | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Folder links (`./library/`, `../../`) | `./library/index.html` | Capacitor serves any extensionless path as the root page (SPA routing), so a folder link would open the home page. `app/shim.js` does the same at click time for links the site's JS builds (search results, home picks, framework lists). |
| Google Fonts | `www/fonts/` from `@fontsource` | The same four families and weights (Amiri, Noto Naskh Arabic, IBM Plex Sans Arabic, Newsreader), so it reads offline with the site's own typography. |
| 21 PDFs (~20 MB) | Links to the live site | Keeps the app small; the OS opens them in the browser or its PDF viewer. |

`npm run check` refuses a `www/` where any local link on any page fails to resolve to a file, where any page
still loads Google Fonts, or where the shim is missing. The shim also keeps the status bar in step with the site's
light/dark theme.

## Every build

```
cd mobile && npm install
npm run sync          # builds www/ from the site in this repo, checks it, cap sync
```
Set `TURATH_SRC=/path/to/turath-2026` to build from another copy of the site.

**Android.** Every push touching `mobile/` runs `.github/workflows/android.yml`, which builds a debug APK and
uploads it as the `turath2026-debug-apk` artifact. You can also run it by hand from the Actions tab. Locally:
`npx cap open android`, or `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug`. A Play Store release still needs an upload
keystore (`./gradlew bundleRelease` with signing configured). No keystore is in this repo.

**iOS → TestFlight, from CI (no Mac needed).** `.github/workflows/testflight.yml` builds on a GitHub macOS
runner, signs with Xcode cloud signing and uploads to App Store Connect. The build number is the run number.
Once, before the first run:
1. App Store Connect → Apps → **+** → New App, bundle id `com.turath2026.app`, name Turath2026. If the bundle id
   is not in the list, register it under Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Identifiers.
2. App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API → generate a key with the
   **Admin** role, then add repo secrets `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID` and `ASC_KEY_P8` (the whole .p8 file).

Then push a tag from any branch (`git tag ios-1.0 && git push origin ios-1.0`), or use
Actions → Turath2026 · TestFlight → Run workflow once the file is on `main`.

**iOS, by hand on a Mac.** Same steps as the A Wider Life shell (github.com/Ahmedhaz/a-wider-life-app, `mobile/README.md`). In short:
```
brew install cocoapods
cd mobile && npm install && LANG=en_US.UTF-8 npm run sync
open ios/App/App.xcworkspace          # then Product → Archive → Distribute App
```
`AppDelegate.swift` and `Info.plist` carry the same UIScene fix as the A Wider Life shell (iOS 27 traps at launch
without it). Create the app record for `com.turath2026.app` in App Store Connect before the first upload.

## Icons and splash

`assets/` holds the sources, drawn from the site's `assets/mark.svg`. After changing them:
```
npx capacitor-assets generate --ios --android --iconBackgroundColor '#1F5E57' \
  --splashBackgroundColor '#F5EFE3' --splashBackgroundColorDark '#15130F'
```

## What is NOT built
- No notifications, accounts or anything the site does not do. The app is the site, offline.
- New site content reaches users only with a new app build. Rebuild after publishing.
